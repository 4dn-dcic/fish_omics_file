# Spot_ID - identifier from DNA spot table
# fluor - fluorophore imaged to detect the spot. One of the following: cy3, cy5 or Alexa750
# brightness - peak height in photons
# x_FOV - the original fit x-position relative to the camera and objective, (prior to drift correction, chromatic correction, or conversion to stage coordinates). This is the appropriate coordinate system for correcting optical aberrations.
# y_FOV - the original fit y-position relative to the camera and objective, (prior to drift correction, chromatic correction, or conversion to stage coordinates). This is the appropriate coordinate system for correcting optical aberrations.
# z_FOV - the original fit z-position relative to the camera and objective, (prior to drift correction, chromatic correction, or conversion to stage coordinates). This is the appropriate coordinate system for correcting optical aberrations.
# drift_correct_x - the distance in nm the spot was moved in x based on fiducial tracking
# drift_correct_y - the distance in nm the spot was moved in y based on fiducial tracking
# drift_correct_z - the distance in nm the spot was moved in z based on fiducial tracking
# chrom_correct_x - the distance in nm the spot was moved in x based on chromatic correction map
# chrom_correct_y - the distance in nm the spot was moved in y based on chromatic correction map
# chrom_correct_z - the distance in nm the spot was moved in z based on chromatic correction map
# x_lower - lower bound of 95% confidence interval on X-position after fit
# x_upper - upper bound of 95% confidence interval on X-position after fit
# y_lower - lower bound of 95% confidence interval on Y-position after fit
# y_upper - upper bound of 95% confidence interval on Y-position after fit
# z_lower - lower bound of 95% confidence interval on Z-position after fit
# z_upper - upper bound of 95% confidence interval on Z-position after fit
# a - spots were fit to a 3D Gaussian parameterized by amplitude a, background b, widths sigma_xy, sigma_z. Sigma_xy were pre-calibrated for the system based imaging of 100 nm beads.
# b - spots were fit to a 3D Gaussian parameterized by amplitude a, background b, widths sigma_xy, sigma_z. Sigma_xy were pre-calibrated for the system based imaging of 100 nm beads.
