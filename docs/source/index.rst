4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF)
###########################

A key output of the 4D Nucleome (4DN) project is the open publication of
datasets related to the structure of the human cell nucleus and the genome,
within. Recent years have seen a rapid expansion of FISH-omics methods,
which quantify the spatial organization of DNA, RNA and protein in the
cell and provide expanded understanding of how higher-order chromosome
structure relates to transcriptional activity and cell development.
Despite this progress, FISH-based image-data are not yet routinely made
publicly available upon publication because of the lack of common
specifications for data exchange. This challenge is experienced across
the bioimaging community, as a result a solution built, tested and
proven in 4DN can have a wide impact all over the world.

This document describes the **4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF)**, a community data
format designed for capturing and exchanging the results of FISH-omics
experiments produced within the context of the 4D Nucleome project.

According to the experiment sub-type, this data format is composed
of a specific sub-set of tables. Future extensions will be added here.

- `Chromatin Tracing (FOF-CT)`_
- `Genomic Single Molecule Localization (FOF-GSML)`_
