This description should provide a detailed understanding of the algortithm and of the analysis parameters that were used, in order to guarantee interpretation and reproducibility.","ChrTracer3 software was developed for analysis of raw DNA labeled images. As an input, it takes an.xlsx table containing information and folder names of the DNA experiment. As an output, it returns tab delimited.txt ﬁles with drift-corrected x, y, z positions for all labeled barcodes.
