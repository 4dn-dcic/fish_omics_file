**Spot_ID**,"A unique identifier for this bright Spot.","1",""
**X**,"The sub-pixel X coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported X position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing procedures (i.e. drift correction, chromatic correction etc).","14.43",""
**Y**,"The sub-pixel Y coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported Y position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing procedures (i.e. drift correction, chromatic correction etc).","14.43",""
**Z**,"The sub-pixel Z coordinate of this bright Spot. NOTE: the reported Z position is understood to be the one resulting from any performed post-processing procedures (i.e. drift correction, chromatic correction etc).","1.23",""
**RNA_name**,"This is the official name of the Gene the targeted RNA is transcribed from.","ACTB",""
**Gene_ID**,"This is the official ID for the Gene encoding for the targeted RNA transcript.","ENSG00000075624",""
*Transcript_ID*,"This is the official ID for the targeted RNA transcript. This field is required in case the same Gene has multiple different Transcripts and the FISH probe used in this case is capable of distinguishing between them.","ENST00000646664.1","Conditional requirement: this MUST be reported if multiple transcripts are associated with the same Gene_ID and the FISH probes are capable of distinguishing them."
*Trace_ID*,"This fields reports the unique identifier for a DNA Trace identified as part of this experiment. Note: this is used to connect data in this table with a given Trace and with Trace specific measurements as recorded in the corresponding Trace_Data table.","1","Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if data in this table can be associated with a Trace identified as part of this experiment."
*Sub_Cell_ROI_ID*,"If known, this fields reports the unique identifier for a Region of Interest (ROI) that represents the boundaries of a sub-cellular structure a given Spot is associated with. Note: this is used to connect individual Spots that are part of the same ROI. It is also used to connect data in this table with any ROI specific measurements such as boundaries, intensities or volume, recorded in the corresponding ROI_Data_Table.","1","Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if data in this table can be associated with a Sub_Cell_ROI identified as part of this experiment."
*Cell_ID*,"If known, this fields reports the unique identifier for the Cell a given Spot is associated with. Note: this is used to connect individual Spots that are part of the same Cell. It is also used to connect data in this table with any Cell specific measurements such as boundaries, intensities and volume, recorded in the corresponding Cell_Data_Table.","1","Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if data in this table can be associated with a Cell identified as part of this experiment."
*Extra_Cell_ROI_ID*,"If known, this fields reports the unique identifier for a Region of Interest (ROI) that represents the boundaries of a extracellular structure (e.g., Tissue) a given Spot is associated with. Note: this is used to connect individual Spots that are part of the same ROI. It is also used to connect data in this table with any ROI specific measurements such as boundaries, intensities and volume, recorded in the corresponding ROI_Data_Table.","1","Conditional requirement: this column is mandatory if data in this table can be associated with a extracellular structure ROI (e.g., Tissue) identified as part of this experiment."
