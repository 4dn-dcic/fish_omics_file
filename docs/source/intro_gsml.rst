Introduction
============

This document describes the **4DN FISH Omics Format - Genomic Single Molecule
Localization (FOF-GSML)**, a community data format designed for capturing and
exchanging the results of chromosome imaging experiments produced within the
context of the 4D Nucleome project. FOF-GSML is directly compatible with
single-molecule localization methods for volumetric imaging, such as OligoSTORM
and OligoDNA-PAINT.

Additional tables support the integration of this core with additional
properties such as quality metrics, physical coordinates placing the a genomic
bright Spot in the context of cellular space, multiplexed RNA-FISH results
(https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1912459116) and with additional data that is
better captured at the global Cell (e.g., boundaries and volume), sub-cellular
Region of Interest (ROI; e.g., Nuclear feature or Nucleolus), or extracellular
ROI (e.g., Tissue) level.
