## 4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF) - Chromatin Tracing (CT)

This document describes the **4DN FISH Omics Format (FOF) - Chromatin Tracing (CT)**, a community data format designed for capturing and exchanging the results of FISH-omics experiments produced within the context of the 4D Nucleome (4DN) project.

The format consists of a series of ten tables with different requirement degrees.
The full list of tables and instructions on how to use them can be found at: https://fish-omics-format.readthedocs.io/.

The image below gives a schematic view of the tables and their **required** (*black*), **conditionally required** (*purple*), **recommended** (*blue*), **optional** (*orange*), or content.
